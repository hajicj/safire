SAFIRE: Multimodal Deep Learning
==================================

The Safire library is a Python deep learning experimentation library created
for multimodal experiments. It has two major funcitonalities: the deep learning
component in the ``learning`` module, and the experiment management components
in the rest of the library, especially in the ``data`` module.

It is built around the Theano library for speed and the gensim
library for experiment management. Apart from the library modules, there
is the ``scripts`` component which uses the library to run and evaluate
experiments.
